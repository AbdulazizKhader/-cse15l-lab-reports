# Lab Report 1

Welcome, future me, to the realm of GitHub. It is I, you from the past who probably remembers most of the stuff you took on this lab. So, quick rundown of what we did:
1. Installed VS Code
2. Managed to remotely connect to my CSE 15L course-specific account
3. Tried out some cool command-line commands

1. Go to this [link][id1]. It will take you to the Visual Studio website.
2. Once you get there, download the version that is compatible with your operating system. Basically, download Windows if you are on a Windows.
3. After you install VSCode, you should get sent to a page that looks like this:
