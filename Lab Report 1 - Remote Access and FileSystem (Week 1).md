# Lab Report 1

Welcome, future me, to the realm of GitHub. It is I, you from the past who probably remembers most of the stuff you took on this lab. So, quick rundown of what we did:
1. Installed VS Code
2. Managed to remotely connect to my CSE 15L course-specific account
3. Tried out some cool command-line commands

Let's go through each one separately:

2. Once you get there, download the version that is compatible with your operating system. Basically, download Windows if you are on a Windows.
3. After you install VSCode, you should get sent to a page that looks like this: 
*Side note: it may look a bit different with the colors and such based on your settings*

4. Now you have VSCode installed! To start coding, you just have to install the necessary things for your specific language and you are **good to go!**
