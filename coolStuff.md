# This is some COOL stuff on GitHub! Yes, I like this a lot.  
(Notice how these are on the same line)

Well then, let's get to the cool stuff:  
* This is how you make things **BOLD**. Neat!
* This is how *italic* things work. Fancy, am I right?

Also, if you ever wanted to have a line  
break, its like this: *double space the previous line then enter*

Say you want to look nerdy, do this:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        while(true){
            String currentNumber = scanner.nextLine();

            if(currentNumber.equals("end")){
                break;
            }

            int number = Integer.valueOf(currentNumber);
            int cubed = number * number * number;
            System.out.println(cubed);
        }
    }
```
