## Lab Report 2

Welcome back, me. I need no further introduction, but for reference, I am you from week 3 of spring quarter (off-character, I know). This week was really interesting, since it covered *quite* a few things that you will find interesting. Take a look:
- Joined a group! *Pretty chill ppl ngl*
- Got GitHub Desktop: Explanation of what that is comes below, but it IS something you were wondering how to do
- Used URLs in your code by implementing the URI interface
- Building and running your OWN SERVER!!!
- *Running* that server remotely
- Accessing URLs on the command line (pretty neat, am I right?)
-
