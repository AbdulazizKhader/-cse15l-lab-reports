## Lab Report 4
Welcome back soldier.
This week, you learned a lot about ```vim```, which is a very efficient text editor that allows you to do everything from the editor, including navigation. Most of the stuff you learned are commands, and they all are on the worksheets, so it would be a bit redundant to rewrite them here.
Anywho, let's get to the parts:

### Part 1
We are gonna walk through steps 4-9 in the Baseline task of week 7:
1. *Keys inputted:* ```ssh cs15lsp23cl@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>```. This is just standard remote logging into an account.

2. *Keys inputted:* ``` git clone git@github.com:AbdulazizKhader/lab7.git```. This is a git command to clone the repository from my GitHub account into the ieng6 account. You probably have done this before in lab, so the output will look something like this:
