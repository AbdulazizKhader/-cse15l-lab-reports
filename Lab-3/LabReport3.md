## Lab Report 3
WE BACK AT IT! Past two weeks were a bit stressful cuz you took the 15L Skill Demo a.k.a the *"midterm"*, so we only got info for week 4. This is what happened:
- You learned a bunch of new commands!

### The commands:
So here's a breakdown of what you learned:
> - ```find```: it will take a directory path as an argument and list files and directories inside that directory.  
> - Output redirection ``` > ```: it is used with other methods, and it directs the output of the called method and saves it into a new file you create in the terminal. It looks something like ```find hello.java > hello.txt```
> - ```less```: it does the same thing as ```cat```, but it makes it such that not all the output is printed at once. It prints the first couple of lines and to go to the next line you press enter. To exit, press Q.
> - ```wc```: it stands for word count, and it prints out the number of lines, words, and characters in a file
